This  guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the  application locally. Follow these instructions to set up your development environment and launch your Django application.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
Python: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download the latest version from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Setup
Follow the steps below to set up and run the application:
Clone the Repository:
Clone the repository containing your Django application code from a version control system (e.g., Git). Use the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Oluwateezzy/Discuss.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the project source code as a ZIP file and extract it to a directory of your choice.

Create a Virtual Environment:
I recommend using a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of your Django application. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv myenv
```
     		Replace `myenv` with the desired name for your virtual environment.
Activate the virtual environment. The command may vary depending on your operating system:
For Windows:
 ```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
Install Dependencies:
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required Python packages specified in the project's `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command.
```
pip install django
```


Database Configuration:
Configure the database settings in the `settings.py` file located in the application's directory.
Set the database engine, name, username, password, and other relevant options according to your database setup.

Migrate Database:
Run the following command to apply the database migrations:
```
python manage.py migrate
```
Create a Superuser (Optional):
Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface.
Run the following command and follow the prompts to create a superuser:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Run the Development Server:
Start the Django development server using the following command:
     		```
    	 	python manage.py runserver
     		```
Access the Application:
Open a web browser and visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to access your Django application.
Access the Django admin interface at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/) to manage your application's data.
